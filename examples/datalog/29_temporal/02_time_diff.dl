% Test: time_diff(t1, t2) function
% Category: 29_temporal
% Description: Tests time_diff returns difference between timestamps in milliseconds

.kg create test_time_diff
.kg use test_time_diff

% Insert pairs of timestamps
+timestamps[(1, 1000, 500), (2, 2000, 1500), (3, 1000, 1000)].

% Define rule to compute time difference
result(Id, Diff) :- timestamps(Id, T1, T2), Diff = time_diff(T1, T2).

% Query the results
?- result(Id, Diff).
