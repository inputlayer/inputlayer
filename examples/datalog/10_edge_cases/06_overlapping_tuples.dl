// Test: Overlapping Tuples Between Relations
// Category: 10_edge_cases
// Description: Tests behavior when same tuples exist in different relations

+rel_a[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)].
+rel_b[(2, 3), (3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 7)].

// Union-like behavior via separate rules
view combined(X: int, Y: int) :- rel_a(X, Y).
view combined(X: int, Y: int) :- rel_b(X, Y).

// Intersection via join on same variables
