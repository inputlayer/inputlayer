# Your First Program

Write a social-network reachability query in under 5 minutes.

## What You'll Build

A simple social network that tracks who follows whom, and computes who can reach whom through any chain of follows.

## Step 1: Start the Client

```bash
inputlayer-client
```

You'll see:
```
Connecting to server at http://127.0.0.1:8080...
Connected!

Server status: healthy
Authenticated as: admin
Current knowledge graph: default
```

## Step 2: Create a Knowledge Graph

Every InputLayer program runs in a knowledge graph. Let's create one:

```datalog
.kg create social
```

Output:
```
Knowledge graph 'social' created.
Switched to knowledge graph: social
```

You can verify with:
```datalog
.kg
```

Output:
```
Current knowledge graph: social
```

## Step 3: Add Facts

Facts are the base data in your knowledge graph. Let's add some "follows" relationships:

```datalog
+follows(1, 2)
```

Output:
```
Inserted 1 fact(s) into 'follows'.
```

Let's add more facts using bulk insert:

```datalog
+follows[(2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 3)]
```

Output:
```
Inserted 3 fact(s) into 'follows'.
```

## Step 4: Query Facts

Use `?` to query data:

```datalog
?follows(1, X)
```

Output:

| 1 | X |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 |

*2 rows*

This shows everyone that user 1 directly follows.

## Step 5: Define a Rule

Rules derive new data from existing facts. Let's define "reachable" - who can you reach through any chain of follows?

```datalog
+reachable(X, Y) <- follows(X, Y)
```

Output:
```
Rule 'reachable' registered.
```

This says: "X can reach Y if X follows Y directly."

But we also want transitive reachability. Add another clause:

```datalog
+reachable(X, Z) <- follows(X, Y), reachable(Y, Z)
```

Output:
```
Rule 'reachable' registered.
```

This says: "X can reach Z if X follows someone Y who can reach Z."

## Step 6: Query the Rule

Now query the derived relation:

```datalog
?reachable(1, X)
```

Output:

| 1 | X |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 1 | 4 |

*3 rows*

User 1 can reach users 2, 3, and 4! Even though user 1 doesn't directly follow user 4, they can reach them through the chain: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.

## Step 7: View Your Rules

See what rules are defined:

```datalog
.rule
```

Output:
```
Rules:
  reachable (2 clause(s))
```

See the rule definition:

```datalog
.rule def reachable
```

Output:
```
Rule: reachable
Clauses:
  1. reachable(X, Y) <- follows(X, Y)
  2. reachable(X, Z) <- follows(X, Y), reachable(Y, Z)
```

## Step 8: Add More Data and See Incremental Updates

Add a new follows relationship:

```datalog
+follows(4, 5)
```

Now query reachable again:

```datalog
?reachable(1, X)
```

Output:

| 1 | X |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 1 | 4 |
| 1 | 5 |

*4 rows*

User 1 can now reach user 5! InputLayer automatically recomputed the derived relation when you added new data.

## Complete Program

Here's everything we did in one script:

```datalog
// Create and use knowledge graph
.kg create social
.kg use social

// Add base facts
+follows[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 3)]

// Define transitive reachability
+reachable(X, Y) <- follows(X, Y)
+reachable(X, Z) <- follows(X, Y), reachable(Y, Z)

// Query: who can user 1 reach?
?reachable(1, X)
```

You can save this to a file `social.idl` and run it:

```bash
inputlayer-client --script social.idl
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Facts** (`+relation(...)`) are base data you insert
2. **Rules** (`+head(...) <- body`) derive new data from existing data
3. **Queries** (`?pattern`) ask questions about your data
4. **Incremental** - When you add/remove facts, derived data updates automatically
5. **Persistent** - Facts and rules are saved to disk

## What's Different from SQL?

| SQL | InputLayer |
|-----|---------------------|
| `INSERT INTO follows VALUES (1, 2)` | `+follows(1, 2)` |
| `CREATE VIEW` (limited recursion) | `+rule(...) <- body` (full recursion) |
| `SELECT * FROM follows WHERE a = 1` | `?follows(1, X)` |
| Explicit JOINs | Implicit joins via shared variables |
