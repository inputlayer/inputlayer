# Queries

Queries retrieve data from InputLayer. They return matching facts without modifying any data.

## Basic Syntax

Queries start with `?`:

```datalog
?edge(X, Y)
```

## Grammar

```ebnf
query ::= "?" body ;
body  ::= literal ("," literal)* ;
```

## Query Patterns

### Get All Data

Query all facts in a relation:

```datalog
?edge(X, Y)
```

Result:

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 |

*3 rows*

### Filter by Value

Fix one column to filter results:

```datalog
// Edges starting from node 1
?edge(1, Y)
```

Result:

| 1 | Y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |

*1 rows*

### Check Existence

Query with all constants to check if a fact exists:

```datalog
?edge(1, 2)
```

If the fact exists, you get a result with the constant values as columns. If it doesn't exist, you get `No results.`

### Ignore Columns

Use `_` (wildcard) to ignore columns you don't need:

```datalog
// Get all source nodes (ignore destination)
?edge(X, _)
```

Result:

| X |
|---|
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |

*3 rows*

## Queries with Conditions

### Comparisons

Filter results with comparison operators:

```datalog
?person(Name, Age), Age > 25
```

### Multiple Conditions

Combine conditions with commas (AND):

```datalog
?person(Name, Age), Age >= 18, Age <= 65
```

### Negation

Find facts that don't match a pattern:

```datalog
// People who are not managers
?employee(Id, Name), !manager(Id)
```

## Joins

### Two-Way Join

Join two relations:

```datalog
?employee(Id, Name), works_in(Id, DeptId), department(DeptId, DeptName)
```

This finds employees with their department names.

### Self-Join

Join a relation with itself:

```datalog
// Find pairs where A follows B and B follows A (mutual follows)
?follows(A, B), follows(B, A), A < B
```

The `A < B` avoids duplicate pairs.

## Querying Views

Query derived relations (views) the same way as base relations:

```datalog
// Define a rule
+path(X, Y) <- edge(X, Y)
+path(X, Z) <- path(X, Y), edge(Y, Z)

// Query the derived data
?path(1, X)
```

## Computed Values

### Arithmetic

Compute values in queries:

```datalog
?product(Name, Price, Qty), Total = Price * Qty
```

### Vector Functions

Compute distances or similarities:

```datalog
?vectors(Id1, V1), vectors(Id2, V2),
   Id1 < Id2,
   Dist = euclidean(V1, V2)
```

## Aggregations in Queries

For aggregations, define a rule first then query it:

```datalog
+dept_count(Dept, count<Id>) <- works_in(Id, Dept)
?dept_count(Dept, Count)
```

## Result Format

Query results are displayed as formatted tables with column headers:

| Name | Age |
|---|---|
| "alice" | 30 |
| "bob" | 25 |

*2 rows*

If no matches are found:

```
No results.
```

## Examples

### Simple Lookup

```datalog
+person[("alice", 30), ("bob", 25), ("charlie", 35)]

?person("alice", Age)
```

Result:

| "alice" | Age |
|---|---|
| "alice" | 30 |

*1 rows*

### Filtered Search

```datalog
+employee[(1, "alice", 75000), (2, "bob", 65000), (3, "charlie", 80000)]

?employee(Id, Name, Salary), Salary > 70000
```

Result:

| Id | Name | Salary |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "alice" | 75000 |
| 3 | "charlie" | 80000 |

*2 rows*

### Complex Query

```datalog
// Data
+follows[(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (2, 1)]

// Find mutual follows
?follows(A, B), follows(B, A), A < B
```

Result:

| A | B |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 |

*2 rows*

### Query with Aggregation

```datalog
+sales[("north", 100), ("north", 200), ("south", 150)]

// Define aggregation rule
+total_by_region(Region, sum<Amount>) <- sales(Region, Amount)

// Query it
?total_by_region(Region, Total)
```

Result:

| Region | Total |
|---|---|
| "north" | 300 |
| "south" | 150 |

*2 rows*
